# Solidity Error Handling Assessment

This repository is for the project assessment of the  module-1 of the Solidity-AVAX-Intermediate course at Metacrafters Academy.

## Problem Statement

Write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three functions that take input values, check conditions using error handling statements, and execute accordingly.

- The check_require function takes one uint value and requires the input value to be greater than or equal to 0 using require() for setting value. If the value is less than or equal to zero the function will return the string "Value must be greater than zero". It basically simulates setting up a balance in your account which you can withdraw from using the latter functions.
- The check_assert checks that the operation of doubling the value from the previous function didn’t result in overflow. If something went wrong internally, the contract would stop execution.
- The check_revert function takes one uint value, and checks if it is greater than set value. If it is greater then it returns the string "Not enough funds to withdraw". If it is less, then it is deducted from the set value simulating you withdrawing from an account.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Go to the Remix website at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile SimpleErrorHandlingContract.sol" button.

3. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the SimpleErrorHandlingContract contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

4. Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling any of the three functions: check_require, check_assert, and check_revert. Enter the appropriate values and then click on "call" to execute the functions.
